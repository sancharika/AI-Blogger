## Features

1. **Text and Voice Input:** Users can input their blog topics either through text input or by recording their voice using the microphone button.
2. **Customizable Parameters:** The tool allows users to customize various parameters such as desired tone (informative, casual, persuasive, formal, humorous), writing style (for researchers, data scientists, common people), maximum character limit, language, and specific instructions.

3. **AI Model Integration:** The project integrates with Google's Generative AI (genai) model to generate blog content based on the provided input and parameters.
4. **Copy to Clipboard:** Generated blog content can be easily copied to the clipboard for further use or sharing.

5. **Streamlit Interface:** The user interface is built using Streamlit, making it easy to deploy and use through a web browser.
